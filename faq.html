<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">9. What if Siri doesn't recognize my custom phrase?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Ensure your phrase is clear and unique. If you need to, rename the shortcut so it's more natural to you and easier to understand for Siri. Adding "with Penny" at the end of the name can help Siri understand that it's a shortcut associated with Penny. So consider changing the phrase to something like "Create a Festival Foods expense with Penny"strong> and see if that works better.
