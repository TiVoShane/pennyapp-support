    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">1. How do I log an expense?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can log an expense by simply telling Penny about the expense. An expense requires some type of description, an amount, a category, and a date when it occurred.  For example, "I spent $30 at Best Buy today.  Categorize it as Shopping", or "I paid $50 to golf at Hilly Golf Course today.  Categorize it as Active Lifestyle". You can either type in your expense details or use the voice input feature to speak your expense. For example, say "Spent $50 on groceries at Whole Foods."</p>

        <div class="faq-question">2. Can I edit or delete an expense?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, you can edit or delete an expense. Go to the "Expenses" tab, and tell Penny what you want to modify.  For example, "Penny, can you delete teh golf expense from yesterday, please?" or "That Best Buy expense was supposed to be $35, not $30".  Penny will ask any follow-up questions needed and confirm which expense you want her to delete.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">3. How does the app categorize my expenses?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Penny uses AI-powered algorithms to automatically categorize your expenses based on the description you provide. You can also just tell her the category you want. If you put it in the wrong category, ask Penny to move it.  You can also tell Penny "Anytime I shop at Walmart, categorize the expense as Groceries"</p>
