    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">1. How do I log an expense?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can log an expense by simply telling Penny about the expense. An expense requires some type of description, an amount, a category, and a date when it occurred.  For example, "I spent $30 at Best Buy today.  Categorize it as Shopping", or "I paid $50 to golf at Hilly Golf Course today.  Categorize it as Active Lifestyle". You can either type in your expense details or use the voice input feature to speak your expense. For example, say "Spent $50 on groceries at Whole Foods."</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">2. Can I edit or delete an expense?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, you can edit or delete an expense. Go to the "Expenses" tab, and tell Penny what you want to modify.  For example, "Penny, can you delete the golf expense from yesterday, please?" or "That Best Buy expense was supposed to be $35, not $30".  Penny will ask any follow-up questions needed and confirm which expense you want her to delete.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">3. How does the app categorize my expenses?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Penny uses AI-powered algorithms to automatically categorize your expenses based on the description you provide. You can also just tell her the category you want. If you put it in the wrong category, ask Penny to move it.  You can also tell Penny "Anytime I shop at Walmart, categorize the expense as Groceries"</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">7. Can I create multiple custom shortcuts for different expenses?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes! You can create as many custom shortcuts as you'd like for various expenses, categories, or stores.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">8. How do I edit or delete a custom shortcut?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>In the Shortcuts app, go to the <strong>My Shortcuts</strong> tab. Tap the <strong>"..."</strong> button to edit or swipe left on the shortcut to delete it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">9. What if Siri doesn't recognize my custom phrase?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Ensure your phrase is clear and unique. If you need to, rename the shortcut so it's more natural to you and easier to understand for Siri.  Adding "with Penny" at the end of the name can help Siri understand that it's a shortcut associated with Penny.  So consider changing the phrase to something like <strong>"Create a Festival Foods expense with Penny"</strong>strong> and see if that works better.</p>
    </div>

</div>

<h3>What if Siri doesn't recognize my custom phrase?</h3>
<p>Ensure your phrase is clear and unique. If issues persist, try re-recording the phrase or using a different one.</p>
